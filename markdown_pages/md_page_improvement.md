## Improvement

How are you improving over time for different workout length? These graphs show you the improvement for each of the workout durations that has had at least one ride in the last 60 days.

The first ride in the time range selected is the baseline ride. All other rides become a percentage improvement on that baseline ride. If a ride is worse than the baseline, itâ€™s simply a zero as well.

For example, if you have three rides at 150kj, 180kj, and 200kj output, the first ride is zero, and the other two rides are 20% and 33% improvement on that first ride respectively.

The following metrics are available:

* **Output:** a combination of cadence and resistance, output is the raw energy you put into the ride.
* **Fitness:** this is the output, measured in Joules (j), generated with each heart beat (hb). The more output you can create with every heartbeat, the fitter you are. This requires using a heartbeat monitor connected to your bike while doing your rides.
