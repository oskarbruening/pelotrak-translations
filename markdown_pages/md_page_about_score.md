## The PeloPower System

PeloPower points is designed to reflect effort and improvement. To allow comparisons between rides and riders, it does not use the absolute output of a ride, but the relative improvement of the output against previous rides.

In other words, instead of asking "what is your output?", which depends on a lot of factors such as length of ride, personal fitness, etc. it asks "are you improving yourself?".

## The PeloPower Philosophy

PeloPower rewards effort as well as improvement.

**Effort** is simply based on the number of minutes you spent exercising.

**Improvement** is based on the percentage improvement of the output against your own 6-week baseline, which is basically the equivalent of a **handicap**. The fitter you are, the higher your handicap. As a result, a PeloPower of 70 pts is somewhat equally hard to achieve for a relative novice as it is for an experienced rider.

This allows everyone to compete both with themselves, as they seek improvement, and with others, regardless of their different level of fitness.

## How It Is Calculated

Every PeloPower consists of the following three components:

* **Improvement Points:** For every duration (e.g a 20 min class), the output of the workout is compared to a baseline based on the previous 6 weeks. You get 1 point for every 0.1% improvement in output over that 6-week baseline. If you do not exceed the baseline, this part of PeloPower is zero. Classes that do not have an output, like Yoga, are ignored when calculating the baseline.
* **Effort Points:** You get points for showing up. Depending on the length of the workout, you get a certain number of points (see list below).
* **Bonus Points:** For special incentives, e.g getting an early start on your workout in the week, bonus points are available.

These calculations are available in the details of your workout. Your weekly PeloPower is the sum of the PeloPower points of all workouts from a given week. A week starts on Sunday morning at midnight and ends on Saturday evening at midnight.

Note that 5 minute and 10 minute workouts are not included.

### Effort Points

Depending on the length of the workout, the following effort points are assigned.

15min = 20pts, 20min = 39pts, 30min = 44pts, 45min = 49pts, 60min = 53pts, 75min = 56pts, 90min = 58pts.

### Bonus Points

Bonus points currently available:

* **Early Bird:** get a head start on your week by working out on Sundays and Mondays and get an extra 10 points per workout.
* **Personal Record:** get 10 points for every time you break your personal best.

## Common Questions

**I see my total number of workouts, which takes into account yoga classes, meditation, etc. If there is no output for these classes, does that bring down my points?**

You still get credit for those classes, but only the effort component. For example, a 20 minute Yoga class will always be 39pts. And since your weekly PeloPower is always additive, it'll only add, not subtract. These zero-output classes are ignored when the 6-week baseline is calculated.


## Limitations

Scores are capped at 500 improvement points (50% improvement over baseline).

Because of performance and privacy concerns, the 6 week baseline, and therefore the improvement points, can only be calculated on the phone in the app.

This means, in leaderboards with your friends who are not using Pelotrak, only the effort part for their workouts may be shown. These PeloPower points are typically marked in gray. If the rider has Pelotrak and the points for the ride have been computed on their phone, the points will show up in your leaderboard in black.
