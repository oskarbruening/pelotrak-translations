## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Difference Between Watts and KJ?

Both are used to measure your output. KJ (KiloJoule) is the total output generated in a workout. Watts is the output generated for a given time.

It's equivalent of distance vs. speed. Your KJ is like the total distance traveled. Your Watts is like the speed you are working out at.

1 Watt Hours = 3.6 jk. This means if you exercise at a steady output 100 Watts, after an hour the total output of the exercise will be 360 kj.

### Why Do Some Reports Say "No Data"?

Most likely, this is because there is no heart rate data available for the workout or the set of workouts. To have heart rate data, you need to make sure to use a heart rate monitor during your workouts. Consider purchasing a heart rate monitor like the [Scosche Rhythm+](https://www.amazon.com/Scosche-RHYTHM-Heart-Monitor-Armband/dp/B00JQHTJS2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=10876JQB3A9VI&dchild=1&qid=1602456750&sprefix=rythm+heart,aps,157&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=pelotrak-20&linkId=403bf107ad84d74a1e42b9c583fecc88&language=en_US) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Scosche-RHYTHM-Heart-Monitor-Armband/dp/B00JQHTJS2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=10876JQB3A9VI&dchild=1&qid=1602456750&sprefix=rythm+heart,aps,157&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=pelotrak-20&linkId=403bf107ad84d74a1e42b9c583fecc88&language=en_US)) or [Wahoo TICKR FIT](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078GRMFSN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=pelotrak-20&linkId=b672b466d307677cec8d53975570efce&language=en_US) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078GRMFSN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=pelotrak-20&linkId=b672b466d307677cec8d53975570efce&language=en_US)).

For your heart rate zones to be correct, make sure you configure your maximum heart rate in your Peloton account.

### I deleted a workout from Peloton but it still shows up in Pelotrak. How do I delete it in Pelotrak?

For normal refreshes, Pelotrak only looks for new workouts. If you delete a workout in Peloton, you need to do a full reload. Go to "About" (the heart in the bottom right), then "Settings", and then on "Full Reload". That will clear out deleted workouts.

### I see my total number of workouts, which takes into account yoga classes, meditation, etc. If there is no output for these classes, does that bring down my points?

You still get credit for those classes, but only the effort component. For example, a 20 minute Yoga class will always be 39pts. And since your weekly PeloPower is always additive, it'll only add, not subtract. These zero-output classes are ignored when the 6-week baseline is calculated.

### Why Am I Not Seeing All My Data in Pelotrak?

To ensure performance, Pelotrak only pulls the following data on an initial load:

* At least 15 months of workouts, but caps beyond that at 400 workouts.
* The performance metrics of the last 50 workouts longer than 10min, eg the output curve, heart data
* The last 14 days of workouts of your friends

On a data refresh, it looks only for new data since the last data pull.
