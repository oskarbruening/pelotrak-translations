## Why Power Zones Works

Getting fitter and faster is not just about adding more muscles. It's also, for example, about increasing your muscles' efficiency to absorb the oxygen in your blood. That allows your muscles to work harder with every heart beat.

By training in different Power Zones, you train different aspects of your fitness. When you "trust the system" and invest in a Power Zone Challenge (more on that in the Getting Started section below), all the little improvements to the different aspects of your fitness compound together, often to quite astonishing results.

## What Is Power Zone Training?

The training is based on identifying your current fitness and assigning seven different zones. You have to frequently reassess your fitness and the associated zones to keep the training relevant and meaningful to you.

The training consists of the following core concepts:

* **FTP** stands for **Functional Threshold Power** and is a metric that represents your personal fitness level. The FTP determines your power zones for your training. As you get fitter, your FTP and therefore your zones will change. This ensures that the classes will continue to challenge you the right amount. You should do a FTP test regularly to account for your improvements in fitness.
* **Power Zones** are seven different levels of difficulties based on your fitness. They allow the trainer to focus a class on a specific difficulty (eg zone 2 + 3). Everyone will have different zones, but because they are based on the individual’s fitness, a training for zone 3 will challenge everyone equally.
* There are 3 different class types focusing on different zones. Together they will improve your overall fitness. Your best training consists of a healthy mix of them.
* There are several metrics that help you track your fitness and plan your rides. The most important ones are **FTP (Functional Threshold Power)** to assess your fitness and **TSS (Training Stress Score)** which is the output of a ride relative to your fitness.

## FTP and TSS

These are the most important metrics to track and understand.

### FTP (Functional Threshold Power)

This is your fitness. It is measured in Watts and is the average output you should be able to sustain for an hour if you try as hard as you can. Peloton offers 20min FTP tests to help you estimate your current FTP number.

Your FTP determines your zones: e.g. zone 1 is 0-55% of your FTP. So if your FTP is 160 Watts, your zone 1 is from 0 to 88 Watts.

You should do a new FTP test “whenever your fitness changes”. For people following the Power Zone training, it means every 6-8 weeks, depending how often you ride. Ideally, you take the exact same test under the exact same conditions (time of day, amount of sleep, etc).

Tracking your FTP also allows you to track your change in fitness over time and is recommended doing before and after a challenge.

### TSS (Training Stress Score)

The TSS is similar to the **total output from a workout** (similar to kj). The longer or harder you ride, the higher the number. However, it is normalized using your FTP, meaning it is centered around your personal fitness:

A TSS of 100 means that you held your FTP output for a full hour. A TSS of 150 means you held your FTP output for 1.5 hours. A TSS of 50 means you held your FTP output for 0.5 hours.

The maths gets a bit complicated though when your average output is not exactly your FTP: doing half an hour workout at twice your FTP output does not exactly give you a TSS of 100. But it’s close enough.

The TSS can aid in three ways:

* compare how much effort you put into rides
* help you understand your body’s recovery needs
* personalize professional training plans

**TSS For Recovery Periods**

Add up the TSS from all your rides in a single day and use the table below to figure out your recommended recovery period. Keep in mind that good sleep and nutrition are also a key factor for a healthy recovery.

| Total TSS of the day | Description | Recommended Recovery Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Less than 100 TSS | Low | Easily recovered the next day |
| 100-200 TSS | Medium | Some residual fatigue present the following day, gone by the 2nd day |
| 200-300 TSS | High | Residual fatigue usually present after 2 days |
| 300-400 TSS | Very High | Residual fatigue usually lasting 2-4 days likely |
| >More than 400 TSS | Epic | Residual fatigue requires 5 days to dissipate |

**TSS For Training Plans**

You can use your TSS to personalize a professional training plan. For example, a plan could look like this:

| Total Week | 300 TSS |
| --- | --- |
| Monday | 50 TSS |
| Tuesday | 30 TSS |
| Wednesday | 60 TSS |
| Friday | 30 TSS |
| Saturday | 80 TSS |
| Sunday | 50 TSS |

(Example from [Matt Wilpers TSS blog post](http://blog.mattwilpers.com/training-stress-scores/))

You can use Pelotrak's TSS Ride Search feature to find rides matching your target TSS.

## What Do The Zones Mean And How Are They Used?

| Zone | % of FTP | Fancy Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zone 1 - Very Easy | 0-55 | Active Recovery | Easy, can do this all day |
| Zone 2 - Moderate | 56-75 | Endurance | Long ride, easy pace |
| Zone 3 - Sustainable | 76-90 | Tempo | Can do for hours |
| Zone 4 - Challenging | 91-105 | Lactate Threshold | Can do for a bit more than an hour |
| Zone 5 - Hard | 106-120 | VO2 Max | Can do for ~10-15min |
| Zone 6 - Very Hard | 121-150 | Anaerobic Capacity | Can do for 30sec-5min max |
| Zone 7 - Max Effort | 151+ | Neuromuscular Power | Can do for a few seconds only |

These zones guide your training. Peloton offers the following training classes:

* **Power Zone Endurance (PZE) Classes** focus on low intensity zones 2 + 3.
* **Power Zone (PZ) Classes (“Traditional PZ classes”)** will typically have a focus on zones 4-6.
* **Power Zone Max (PZM) Classes** typically focus on zones 4-7.

## P/W, W/kg, NP, And IF

There are a range of secondary metrics used in the context of Power Zone training. Here’s a quick overview.

### P/W or W/kg

Referred to either as P/W (Power to Weight ratio) or W/kg (Watts per kilogram) is a metric that takes the FTP fitness one step further. It takes the weight of the rider into account. The weight matters, because the heavier the rider, the more mass has to be moved up a hill and the more power is needed.

In other words, if you want to go faster on a bike, you can either increase your power (fitness) or decrease your weight.

The P/W metric allows comparison of athletes of different fitness and different weights.

It is calculated by taking the FTP and dividing it by the athlete’s weight in kg. For pounds, take the FTP and divide it by the weight in pounds and then multiply by 2.2.

Here are some typical P/W numbers:

* An average “untrained”, i.e. non-competitive, non-racing, cyclist has a P/W of 2.22 (men) / 1.83 (women)
* The average “serious cyclist”, usually competing in races, has a P/W of 3.55 (men + women)
* Pro cyclists are in the range of 5.36-5.93 (men) / 4.60-5.10 (women)
* The world champions have a ratio of 6.60 (men) / 5.69 (women)

### Normalized Power (NP)

Unfortunately, your body is not a linear machine: Your muscles warm up and eventually fatigue. You burn glucose at changing rates and deplete your glucose reserves. Your body produces stress hormones in response to the intensity of the workout. All of this changes your ability to create and hold a steady output.

Normalized Power uses complex formulas to try to give a more accurate description of your output of a given workout. Where the standard output (kj) describes the energy produced, Normalized Power tries to quantify the impact on the body. In essence, it is an estimate of the power that you could have maintained for the same physiological  “cost” if your power output had been perfectly constant.

Normalized Power is how your TSS is calculated.

### Intensity Factor (IF)

The Normalized Power is the actual power impact on your body. But to be able to compare your rides over time and to other athletes, you still need to normalize for your fitness. The intensity factor does that by taking your NP of a ride and dividing it by your FTP.

Typical IF values for various training sessions or races are as follows:

* Less than 0.75 = recovery rides
* 0.75-0.85 = endurance-paced training rides
* 0.85-0.95 = tempo rides, aerobic and anaerobic interval workouts (work and rest periods combined), longer (>2.5 h) road races
* 0.95-1.05 = lactate threshold intervals (work period only), shorter (&lt;2.5 h) road races, criteriums, circuit races, longer (e.g., 40 km) TTs
* 1.05-1.15 = shorter (e.g., 15 km) TTs, track points race
* Greater than 1.15 = prologue TT, track pursuit, track miss-and-out

## Getting Started

There are some great online communities and resources available for Power Zone Training. Step one: take an FTP test. That's your baseline for improvement. If you are using Peloton, make sure to take a 10 minute FTP warm up first.

### Peloton Intro Course

Peloton offers a 5-week intro course called “Discover Your Power Zones”. Note that this is a beginner course, so some of the rides might seem easy at first. But it’s a good way to get into the habit.

### Power Zone Pack Challenges

This community organizes regular challenges, which are multi-week trainings with 4-5 Power Zone rides per week. The community is very responsive and supportive and highly recommended.

## FAQ

### What’s the difference between kj and kcal

Both are a unit of energy. 1 Calorie (kcal) is equivalent to 4.185 KiloJoules (kj).

Calories (kcal) is used to measure how much energy your body is burning, while KiloJoules (kj) is used to measure how much energy your body has produced. Typically, only 20-25% of the energy burnt by your body converts into output energy.

As a result, their numbers look similar: if your body burns one Calorie, the output on the bike will be 0.20-0.25 Calories which, converted to KiloJoules, is 0.84-1.05 kJ. So, in the end, you get about 1kj of output for every 1kcal you burn.

The exact conversion rate depends on your body’s metabolism. Calories are used for nutrition plans while cycling performance is based on KiloJoules.

### Why Can’t I Just Use My Heart Rate As a Guide?

Your heart rate measures the intensity of your body’s intention which is also dependent on sleep, nutritions, stress, and other factors. Therefore, building training around your heart rate would likely be very inconsistent. By focusing on the actual output through the power zones, you can ensure consistent training.
