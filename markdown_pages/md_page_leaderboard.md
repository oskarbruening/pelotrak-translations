## Leaderboard Position

How did you compare to other riders and how is it changing over time? This tracks your percentile performance on the class leaderboard.

For example, if you are number 100 out of 1,000 riders taking the class, your leaderboard percentile is 10%, meaning you are in the top 10% of riders for that class.

Note that these numbers are just indicative and can vary a lot depending on your fitness and who else has taken the class so far. Once several hundred people have taken a class though, the leaderboard percentile tends not to move very much.

It can be a good goal to try to stay within a band of percentiles for your rides.
