## Oskar's Tips for Newbies

Here are some tips I have gather over time that you might find useful. Email me your favorite tip to add.

### Fundamentals

* Always do a 5-10min cool down and 5-10min stretch after a ride. You will never be sore.
* If you ride, make sure your seat has the right adjustment. The wrong distance between the seat and the pedals can make your rides more exhausting.
* Try to keep a week streak going. Even just one workout a week during a busy time is better than dropping off completely and then having to restart a month later.
* Get and use a heart rate monitor right away. So of your improvements will come from your heart health and starting to track that early helps you see the improvements you make.
* If you ride, do an FTP test early. Eventually, you will be interested in whether and how your fitness has improved and an FTP test is your first benchmark for that.
* Join one or more [Peloton communities](https://www.pelobuddy.com/tribes/?utm_source=pelotrak).
* Hydrate
* Mix your workouts. For example, do some strength training to complement your rides or runs.
* Don't push yourself beyond what you are comfortable with. This is all about you and you go at your own pace.

### Stepping It Up

* Start participating in Power Zone challenges.
* Watch your active recovery output. During a workout, set yourself a minimum output you will not go below during the active recoveries.
* Do a 90min Matt Wilpers Power Zone Endurance ride every so often. It'll do wonders to your fitness and Matt is a great coach, he always has great tips on these rides.
