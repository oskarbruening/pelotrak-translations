## Your Best Classes

Track when you had your best classes and how your most recent classes compare to them. Classes are compared using:

* **Output:** a combination of cadence and resistance, output is the raw energy you put into the class.
* **Fitness:** this is the output, measured in Joules (j), generated by each heart beat (hb). The more output you create with every heart beat, the fitter you are. This metric requires a [heart rate monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Scosche-RHYTHM-Heart-Monitor-Armband/dp/B00JQHTJS2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=10876JQB3A9VI&dchild=1&qid=1602456750&sprefix=rythm+heart,aps,157&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=pelotrak-20&linkId=403bf107ad84d74a1e42b9c583fecc88&language=en_US).
* **Leaderboard Position:** how did you compare to other athletes on the leaderboard? This is your top leaderboard performance. A 10.5% means you are in the top 10.5% of athletes for that class.

The cards only show class durations which have had a workout in the last 60 days. Classes with durations of 5 and 10 minutes are ignored.

Don’t get discouraged if your metrics are down and it’s been a while since you broke a personal record. Spending time in the saddle will fix that.
