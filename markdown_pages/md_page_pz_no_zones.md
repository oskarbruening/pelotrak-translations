# Missing Zone Targets

The zone targets the instructors provide during a power zone ride are not shared by Peloton. Instead, they are collected by the Pelotrak community.

You can help adding missing zone targets by recording the zones during your ride using the Pelotrak zone target recording tool. Go to the "Power Zone Training" section, then "Record New Zone Targets".
