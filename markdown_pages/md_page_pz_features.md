**Woohoo!!** ðŸŽ‰ Pelotrak now offers a wide range of features for power zone athletes. Below an overview of the different features and their purpose.

**Known Limitations:** if you have a manual FTP configured in Peloton, that data is not pulled into Pelotrak. You can add manual FTPs by going to the Power Zone Training page and then click on "show all" above the FTP test chart.

## FTP Test Detection

Everytime you do an FTP test, Pelotrak will detect it and use the new FTP as the current FTP going forward.

## Workout Data

For every workout, power zone ride or not, Pelotrak now computes the TSS and zones for the ride and shows the Power Zone Output chart as well as the Output Distribution chart. It also shows the FTP used to calculated the TSS and the Power Zones and how long before this ride that FTP was established. If the FTP is older than 10 weeks, the data will be flagged accordingly as it is potentially no longer accurate.

The **Power Zone Chart** shows your output and the corresponding zones throughout the ride. If the community has collected the instructor's zone targets (see below), you can tap on the chart to show those targets as a line, as a range, or hide them completely.

The **Output Distribution** chart shows more precisely where you spent your time. Along the bottom axis, output is grouped into 5kj segments. The height of each bar in that segment represents how much time you spent in that segment throughout the ride. The color represents the zone to which that segment belongs. Below that a percentage distribution is shown to highlight what percent of the ride was spent in which zone. This graph is used also for the Power Zone Challenges (see below).

## TSS Insights

For every ride, the TSS will be calculated. If the TSS exceeds recovery limits, the corresponding recommendation for one or multiple recovery days will be made. 

To learn about TSS, please check out the Power Zone Intro.

## TSS Summaries And Goals

The **weekly and monthly summaries** now include your cumulative TSS for the week. This allows you to also set TSS goals for the week or month.

## FTP Overview

In the Power Zone Training section, your most recent FTP is always shown as well as how long ago it was. If the FTP was more than 10 weeks ago, a warning is shown as the FTP test may no longer be accurate.

There is also a graph showing up to the 7 most recent FTP results and a link ("show all") to show all FTP results. There you can add manual FTP results as well.

## Power Zone Challenges

For those participating in Power Zone Challenges, like the ones offered by the awesome people of Power Zone Pack, there is a Power Zone Challenge section. There you can define the start date and the length of the challenge in weeks. Pelotrak then shows all rides within that time range, groups them by week where the first day of the week is the same as the start date. I.e. if you select Tuesday as your start date for your challenge, every week of the challenge starts on Tuesdays.

For each week the TSS for each ride is shown as well as a cumulative TSS for the whole week. Also, an Output Distribution chart is shown for each week, showing in which zones you spent your time during the week.

A chart is shown at the top showing the total TSS week over week.

You can create as many challenges as you would like, for past and future. Note though that challenges cannot overlap. And future challenges are empty until you start taking rides during that time.

## TSS Ride Search

If you are planning your own challenges, the TSS Ride Search might come in useful. You can set a target TSS value and Pelotrak will search the community ride library and your own past rides for rides with a TSS +/- 10. So if you are looking for a target TSS of 30, you will see rides with a TSS of 20-40. The ones closest to 30 will show up first.

## Community Zone Targets

Unfortunately, Peloton does not record or share the zone targets the instructors call out. To provide that kind of data, Pelotrak has a recording tool built in. While taking a power zone ride, you can easily record the zones the instructor calls out and Pelotrak will record them and share them with the community. Once these zones are recorded, the target TSS for those rides is available as well.

Rides with Community Zone Targets are listed in the **Ride Library**.
