## Hi!

I’m Oskar. I created Pelotrak as a passion project to get more out of my Peloton class data and to better connect with my friends. I hope you enjoy this app and I would love your help making Pelotrak even better.

Ways to help:

### Invite Your Friends

Pelotrak is more fun with friends. And I have some great ideas for new features, but would need more users first. The more the merrier.

### Donation

This is an unpaid side project for me and neither beer nor cloud storage is free. Please consider donating through [Venmo, Zelle, PayPal, or Square Cash](https://qrtips.pkp.ro/?z=obruening@gmail.com&v=OskarCle&s=oskar&p=oskarbruening&a=5) (Venmo username: @OskarCle). Every little bit is appreciated. Thank you!

### New Ideas and Bugs Reports

Do you have some cool ideas on how to make the app better or got a bug to report? You can directly email me at [oskar@pelotrak.com](mailto:oskar@pelotrak.com?subject=New%20Idea). I'd love to hear from you.

Built with ❤️ in Ohio.
