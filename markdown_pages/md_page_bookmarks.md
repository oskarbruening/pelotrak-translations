## Better Manage Your Bookmarks

With Pelotrak, you can now update your Peloton bookmarks. On every refresh, Pelotrak will sync your bookmarks from Peloton. You can also directly bookmark and unbookmark classes within Pelotrak and the change will be updated in Peloton right away.

Some other things you can do:

### Create Lists

Organize your bookmarks into lists. If a class is in a list, it will stay there, even if you remove the bookmark. Lists show you how many of your bookmarks have been completed.

### Add Notes

While a class is either bookmarked and/or in a list, you can add a note to it.

### Clear Out Your Peloton Bookmarks

Have you collected too many bookmarks from too long ago? Need a fresh start? Head to the list settings and clear out your bookmarks. But careful, this will clear them out from Peloton and cannot be undone.

### Collect Bookmarks From Friends

Like a class a friend took? Click on it in the activity feed and bookmark it and list it. By default, classes from friends are automatically added to the "Recommended to Me" list. This can be changed or turned off in the settings.

You can also bookmark classes in the "Popular Classes" section.

### Automatically Unbookmark Classes

Don't want a bookmark to show up on your Peloton after you took the class? Turn on this setting and when you sync your Pelotrak any class newly taken will automatically have its bookmark removed.

### Quick Actions

In the bookmarks page you can swipe left and right on each bookmark for quick actions. Similarly, you can quickly bookmark classes by swiping from the activity feed.

### Things To Note

If a class is in the "No List" section, meaning it's not associated with a list, and then it's unbookmarked, it disappears from the bookmarked section. Classes in lists will stay in the list, even if no longer bookmarked.
