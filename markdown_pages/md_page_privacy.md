## Notes on Privacy

### General Overview

All your personal data is locked on your phone and inaccessible to anyone else. When you sync the app, it directly connects to Peloton to pull your and your followers latest workout data. From that data, all the reports are generated and the PeloPower points are calculated on the phone.

To share updates with your friends, some of your activity data is sent to the Pelotrak cloud storage. Before sharing, your data is completely anonymized using one-way SHA256 hash encryption. All your personally identifiable information, such as your name and username, stay on your phone. Only your friends can make sense of the shared data because they already know who you are.

In addition, basic app usage data is collected using Firebase Analytics, also completely anonymously. This helps understand how the Pelotrak app is being used and what features are most engaging. It is one more way to collect feedback to make the app better.
