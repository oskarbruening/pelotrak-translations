## Quick Overview

Pelotrak provides a number of different charts for your workouts. Which graphs are available depends on the underlying data.

### Output / Heart Rate / Output and Heart Rate

Depending on the data you will see one of these three charts.

* If only our output is available (Peloton bike or tread), you will see the **Output** chart where the bars are blue and the height of the bars corresponds to the output throughout the workout.
* If only your heart rate is available (eg strength workouts with heart rate monitor), you will see the **Heart Rate** chart. The height and the color of the bars correspond to the heart rate the workout.
* If both, output and heart rate are available, you will see the **Output and Heart Rate** chart. The height of the bar corresponds to the output throughout the ride and the color of the bar to the heart rate zone at that time.

### Cadence and Resistance

If the class has resistance and/or cadence targets from the instructors available, you'll see these graphs. The height of the bars corresponds to cadence and resistance throughout the workout. The color of the bars is blue during warm up (first 15%) and cool down (lats 5%). The bars are green when the minimum cadence/resistance has been met or exceeded, red otherwise, as indicated by the range.

### Power Zone Output

This graph shows your output throughout the ride and provides the corresponding zones based on the previous FTP data. If zone targets are provided, a blue line by default shows those zones. You can tap on the graph to change the zone targets from a line to a range or turn off completely.

### Output Distribution

This Power Zone chart shows you were you spent most of your time during a ride. The further you go on the right on the graph, the higher the output. From the graph above you can see that the rider spent most of their time in Zone 4, and mostly in the middle of Zone 4, but also some in Zone 2 and at the lower end of Zone 3.
