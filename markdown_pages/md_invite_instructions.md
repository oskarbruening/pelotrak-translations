2. Sign up for the Pelotrak testing app (http://bit.ly/pltrkios)
3. Once signed up, Apple will send an email with a code (check the spam folder if it doesn't arrive).
4. Open TestFlight and click on "redeem" in the top right corner, enter the code from the email.
5. This allows you to install Pelotrak.
